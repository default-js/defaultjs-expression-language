# Backlog

Open items and findings for `@default-js/defaultjs-expression-language`.

Three kinds of entry live here: defects noticed while working on something else, open questions that need a decision, and work that was agreed but not implemented yet.

One paragraph each — where it is, what is wrong or undecided, what it costs. Enough to act on months later without asking anyone. Entries are written the moment they come up, not at the end of a session, because a session can end at any point. They are deleted once done; git history is the archive.

Anything that affects consumers of the package additionally belongs in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/default-js/defaultjs-expression-language/issues); that call is Frank's.

Entries here are independent of each other. The one undertaking with a forced order — the toolchain modernization — is tracked in `plans/toolchain-modernization.md` instead, and that file is deleted once it is finished.

---

- [ ] **The `CodeCache` size option is silently ignored in three of four executers.**
  `src/executer/WithScopedExecuter.js:6`, `src/executer/ContextObjectExecuter.js:6` and
  `src/executer/EsprimaExecuter.js:16` construct `new CodeCache({ aSize: 5000 })`, but the
  option is named `size` (`src/CodeCache.js:32`). The intended 5000 never applies; those
  caches run at the default of 1000 and trim five times as often as designed.
  `src/executer/ContextDeconstructorExecuter.js:16` gets it right — which is what confirms
  the intended name. Found 2026-08-20.

- [ ] **Decide on `"type": "module"` plus an `exports` field — and what it does to the executer import path.**
  `defaultjs-common-utils` already went this way, so the two packages diverge today. The
  catch: reaching a non-default executer — and with it `setupExecuter(options)` — is done by
  importing its module directly, e.g.
  `@default-js/defaultjs-expression-language/src/executer/EsprimaExecuter.js`. That is the
  intended usage (see `DECISIONS.md`, 2026-08-20) and works only because there is no
  `exports` field. An `exports` field must therefore whitelist `./src/executer/*`, or every
  consumer following the intended pattern breaks. Open alongside it: tuning the *default*
  executer needs the same deep import even though the consumer never imported that module —
  decide whether that stays as is or gets a documented entry point. Not to be mixed into the
  toolchain work; the outcome belongs in `DECISIONS.md`. Found 2026-08-20.

- [ ] **Decide whether to move `espree` 10 → 11.**
  Version 11 raises the **runtime** Node floor for consumers of this package to
  `^20.19 || ^22.13 || >=24`. That is a compatibility decision about the published package,
  not a toolchain bump, so it stays out of the modernization stages. `espree` is only pulled
  in by `EsprimaExecuter`, which is not registered by default — weigh the reach of the change
  against that. The outcome belongs in `DECISIONS.md`. Found 2026-08-20.

- [ ] **`webpack.config.js` refers to `./webcontent`, the directory is `WebContent`.**
  `devServer.static` and `devServer.watchFiles` both use the lowercase spelling
  (`webpack.config.js:57`, `:59`). Windows resolves it, a case-sensitive filesystem will
  not — `npm run dev` would serve nothing on Linux or macOS. Found 2026-08-20.

- [ ] **Decide what happens to Dependabot while the v3 cycle runs.**
  Four branches sit on origin — `engine.io-6.2.1`, `json5-2.2.3`, `ua-parser-js-0.7.33`,
  `webpack-5.76.0` — the newest from 2023-03-15, all opened against `master`, all for
  devDependencies of the old toolchain. `plans/toolchain-modernization.md` sets the target
  versions itself, so the pull requests contradict the plan rather than help it. They no
  longer reach the documentation app now that its version selector runs off tags, so this
  is only about noise: close them and pause Dependabot until after the 3.0.0 release, or
  leave them. Found 2026-08-21.

- [ ] **Every code example in `README.md` uses a default import that does not exist.**
  All examples read `import ExpressionResolver from "@default-js/defaultjs-expression-language"`,
  but `index.js:5` exports only named bindings — `export { ExpressionResolver, ExecuterRegistry }`.
  The default import resolves to `undefined`, so every example in the readme fails at the first
  call. Present since 1.0.0, so not a v3 regression. Two of the examples are additionally
  unbalanced (`README.md:70-78`: the object literal and the argument list are never closed).
  This is goal 4 territory — the readme is what an AI system reads to learn the package, and
  right now it teaches a broken call. Alongside the fix: the readme documents none of v3
  (`ExecuterRegistry`, executers, `setupExecuter`, resolver chains, scopes). Found 2026-08-21.
